2.4.2021

1. Add material design to style
2. Structure the source code directory
3. Add counter redux
4. Review google firebase code with graphql

done:

Added DVR capability via LogRocket
Added Sentry Logging
Added environment var setup

2.8.2021

- Added testing capability with Jest
- Learned about django framework

2.9.2021

- Netlify webserver instead of using nginx?  Unopinionated.  gatsby..cms.  Decouple frontend to backend

Reference:  
- I have no idea what to build.  So I'll get the inspiration from Coinsly
- Look at https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-integrate-django-react-app-with-stripe-payments-95709b3f23e5
- Review CBD 
  - Its use on semantic-ui-react vs material design
  - Wonder if it's possible to do theming
  - Look at the authentication on AWS

- Common theme in any application - requires user authentication and management of profiles.  Possibly oauth
- Add githook to test prior to commit
- Add integration/functional test prior to deployment as part of git hook on the github

2.10.2021

- Done:
  Deployed the app to carbon.domanic.io on netlify
  Looks like the CBD is still up and running based on AWS app function

- Forget redux.  Looks like zustand is much more simple and robust way to go using the React Hook
- Created a dev branch.  So I can affect the change.
- Looks like netlify doesn't have a good environment management system.

Learning about intercom
Learning about cypress.io
Amazing stuff.


2.12.2021
- Reviewed styled-components vs semantic-ui ...  
  Wanted to see how to structure the app for both native and web experience.
  Looks like I need to focus on CSS for the web first.

2.13.2021
- Intro to Adobe Photoshop
- Back to studying django

After two weeks...seems like I forgot what I am doing.  So I'll need to revive this project.  It's going to be a trading/todo/research management application.  So I can track my investment thesis and control my sentiment.  Last week, I earned 10K.  Actually it went up to 40K.  I think I should be able to do this full time and develop my own startup company.  

First thing is that this needs to be very simple...so I can focus.  

Ok...I removed the registration form on the dev branch...rebuilt the docker image and now the application is running back up.

I reviewed the store/usersslice....but it is still fuzzy.  I am going to create a rudimentary django with custom user form and serve graphql.  

I am going to host the backend on AWS for django.  and use cloudformation for RDS and s3 with cloudfront for react frontend.  

Before I productionize this, I'll just use my local dev machine and figure out how to protect ngrok.

Use ngrok next week get the functionality up and running.  

dashboard.ngrok.com

Before I introduce graphql, I'm going to look at how JWT actually work in the very simple usecase.  https://hackernoon.com/110percent-complete-jwt-authentication-with-django-and-react-2020-iejq34ta

I love the fact that I can do most of copying pasting without leaving the keyboard.
My goal next week is to work on authentication on the article above with some custom user changes in django and follow through react.
Another thought.  Secure and encrypted communication without leaving any trace.  It should allow file transfers along with real-time chats.


Ok the author just nailed it.  How to properly manage market events without getting distracted and agitated.  
1. Strategic avoidance
2. Healthy moderate use.

I dont believe there's a such thing as a healthy moderate use.  Like smoking.

I want my app to interrupt me when I should be interupted.  Based on what I'm engaged.  

Bpdy is important as the mind...or concentration..focus...self discipline...and action.  

In addition to reducing the distraction.  How about time management piece.

Practice of using time in a way that maximizes produtiity and efficiency.  For example...reading at night..after the market close.

I am going to deploy something new today.

2.27.2021

I worked on the backend django rest api for user authentication/registration.

Then I switched to the frontend only to get hammered with material design bootstrap react ui library.  I'll need to get a better handle on the bootstrap then move on the material design components.
Created a logon screen...then user registration....with forms.  This is going to get really complicated so I will learn about it tomorrow from the scratch.

2.28.2021

TODO:  Using the portfolio website and create a react side of it.
This will help me familiarize with material design...
Stretch goal.  Deploy carbon reactor with logon screen


I tried it from scratch...loooks like it's broken.  It'd be nice to look at how they converted the components...source code.


3.1.2021

Didn't do any programming today.  But I did create the login and registration screen yesterday.  

Tomorrow. Back on the django jwt authentication project.  This week, do everything on the graphql  

A critical component to this is realtime chat/communication on the stock thesis.  And based on that to draw conviction.  Maybe interface with stocktwits.com  

But for now, I like that my sister and I was able to articulate the conviction, fears, uncertainty and doubts....

Life in a day was kinda amazing.  

Today, the stocks went mostly sideways.  Gained about 2-3K while it was down 8K over the weekend.  Fairly optimistic tomorrow...to make some money.  My goal is to make 10K per week.  


3.19.2021 

It's been a while since I coded.  I made over 22k on a single options trading with rocket.  and since then I've lost all of my portfolio on options.  

I am going to trade now based on signals from tiblio and lock in my risk. 

1st.  Download the data of all the data from tiblio every time there's an update.  Correlate Long calls with selling puts.  that would be a strong buy signal.   

I wonder if I can generate scripts on tradingview.  I am going to focus on this going forward.  

Write an ETL python routine.  


- time to refactor the code.  Finished the first piece of inputing short puts.  Make it into a class.

3.20.2021

Refactored the code.  Dedupe on insert.  Downloading all the data from tiblio except the earnings report.

3.22.2021
Setup a django backend and webhook for finnhub
Completed realtime stock trading data from finnhub
Researched kafka 

I am going to do research on event stream processing now that I am getting incredible amount of realtime data from finnhub
I'll need to start sketching out the front-end of the carbon reactor.  Write documentation on the project.
There are millions of website that gives out analytics on options.
